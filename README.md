## About The Project
### What is Repository Pattern?
A Repository pattern is a design pattern that serves as a conduit for data to and from the Domain and Data Access Layers (such as Entity Framework Core / Dapper). Repositories are classes that hide the logic involved in storing and retrieving data. As a result, our application is unconcerned about the type of ORM we use because everything related to the ORM is handled within a repository layer. This allows for a clearer separation of concerns. The repository pattern is a popular Design Pattern for creating cleaner solutions.
